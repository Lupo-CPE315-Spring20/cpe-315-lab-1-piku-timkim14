# CPE 315 Lab 1 -- Piku

## Things to include in your README

* Your name. Indicate if you go by a nickname: Timothy Kim(Tim)
* Status of your lab: Complete
  * Complete, partially complete, incomplete
  * If not complete, what does work? What doesn't?
* Compilation and execution instructions:
  * `gcc -o piku piku.s`
  * `./piku`
* Issues that you encountered along the way, and anything you have questions about: I was not able to clone my repository into the server so I had to copy and paste code. It said something about there being an issue with it being a remote repository.


These README files have a fairly rich _Markdown_ environment. You should use
markdown syntax to format your README files in such a way that they look
professional, and are easy to read. Use the 
[Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and
have fun! :octocat:
